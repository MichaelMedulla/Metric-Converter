This program only has the conversion for kg to lb, gram to ounces, km to miles, and mm to inches
When asked for an input, either enter "exit" to end the program or enter "# '1unit' to '2unit'"
For example 1 kg to lb
It will continue to loop until you type exit
If there is a typo or if you ask for a conversion not here, it will ask you to input again
